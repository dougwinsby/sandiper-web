# Who are The Sandpiper Authors

We're a small team of volunteers who, in our day-to-day lives, are responsible for the safe, reliable exchange of product information, databases, and tools. Each of us has had to deal with incorrectly synchronized data, sometimes line by line, late into the night before a looming deadline. With the speed of exchange increasing, we knew the situation was only getting worse, so in 2019 we started work on what was to become Sandpiper.
