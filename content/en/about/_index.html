# Who are The Sandpiper Authors

We are a small team of volunteers who, in our day-to-day lives, are responsible for the safe, reliable exchange of product information, databases, and tools. At one time or another, each of us have had to painstakingly untangle incorrectly- or incompletely-synchronized data, sometimes line by line late at night before production refreshes. With the speed of exchange increasing, we knew the situation was going to get worse, so in 2019 we started what became Sandpiper.

Our founding team came from the automotive aftermarket. Early on, however, we realized that the same problems we were trying to solve existed for *all* product data, automotive or otherwise. With that in mind we've kept Sandpiper industry-agnostic as much as possible, and we welcome volunteers from every perspective.
